# Web Based Code Repository Search Engine
Developed a C# based application to search and navigate code repositories. The engine includes remote
file edit capabilities, as well as a static code analyzer that evaluates and produces code metrics,
problematic hot spots and an “Abstract Syntax Tree” representation for the analysis results.
